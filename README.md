### Support

üíü This mod has reached its end of life and is no longer supported or maintained by Kanaverum ([Jonathan Robertson](https://github.com/jonathan-robertson) // me). I am instead focused on my own game studio ([Calculating Chaos](https://calculatingchaos.com), if curious).

‚ù§Ô∏è All of my public mods have always been open-source and are [MIT-Licensed](LICENSE); please feel free to take some or all of the code to reuse, modify, redistribute, and even rebrand however you like! The code in this project isn't perfect; as you update, add features, fix bugs, and otherwise improve upon my ideas, please make sure to give yourself credit for the work you do and publish your new version of the mod under your own name :smile: :tada:

## Admin Commands

This mod adds commands for checking and adjusting any land claim block's activation state.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è When adjusted, the mod will send packages that trick the client into reloading that land claim block's state for the owner (if the owner is online and within range). This means that the land claim owner will not need to log in/out to see the boundaries for this claim appear or disappear when the block's state is modified by the admin.

Command | Description
--- | ---
`lcbr check` | Check the current activation state of the lcb you are within range of.
`lcbr activate` | Activate lcb area frame for the lcb you are within range of (only the lcb owner will see it).
`lcbr deactivate` | Deactivate lcb area frame for the lcb you are within range of.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è When the `activate` or `deactivate` command is run, the land claim block's owner will see an immediate change to the boundaries without having to leave/return or logout/login.
